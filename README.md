# Expression Parser

This projects is an implementation of the [Shunting yard algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunting_yard_algorithm). The algorithm itself is implemented in Rust and compiled to [WASM](https://webassembly.org/) so the code can run on the client-side. Furthermore, there's a frontend page implemented w/ Bootstrap so you can actually write the expressions and get the results in your browser. 

# Motivation

This is a simple project I did to explore the Shunting yard algorithm, the Rust Language and it's WASM capabilities to write web code.
